Title:Intels neuromorphic chip learns to smell 10 hazardous chemicals
Description:Of all the senses scent is a particularly difficult one to teach AI but that doesnt stop researchers from trying. Most recently researchers from Intel and Cornell University trained a neuromorphic chip to learn and recognize the scents of 10 hazardous che
Content:Using Intels Loihi a neuromorphic chip the team designed an algorithm based on the brains olfactory circuit. When you take a whiff of something molecules stimulate olfactory cells in your nose. Those cells send signals to the brains olfactory system wh 1403 chars
